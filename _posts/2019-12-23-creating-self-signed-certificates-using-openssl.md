In an [earlier post](http://sundeepkamath.in/posts/creating-self-signed-certificates/), I discussed how **makecert.exe** tool in **Windows OS** can be used to create **self-signed certificates**.

![Post Banner]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/OpenSSL_banner.png)

We'll now check how the popular **openssl** tool can be used to create these self-signed certificates. One major advantage of this tool is that it is available on all platforms **Windows, Linux and OSX**.

For the sake of this post, we'll use the same scenario as in the [earlier post](http://sundeepkamath.in/posts/creating-self-signed-certificates/), whereby we will generate **server/client certificates** which is signed by a **Root Certificate Authority**. 
Also, we'll use **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on **Windows 10** (specifically **ubuntu 18.04**) to create these certificates.

We'll go about this using following steps
* Preparing the directory structure
* Creating a custom Root Certificate
* Creating a server certificate signed by the Root CA
* Packaging the certificate
* Deploying the certificate

## Preparing the directory
Here is how I suggest you create the directory structure.

Choose a directory `/home/<user>/mycerts/ca` to store all keys and certificates.
You may create it as follows...

![Initial Directory]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/1Openssl_InitialDirectory.png)

Within the `ca` directory create the following set of directories.

![Initial Directory with additional folders]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/2Openssl_InitialDirectory.png)

The `index.txt` and `serial` files act as a flat file database to keep track of signed certificates.

Unlike the **makecert.exe** that Windows OS provides, **openssl** does not provide an option to specify all the attributes via command line. It uses a different approach, the one where you create a separate **configuration file** and provide this configuration file as an input to the **openssl** tool.

You may download this configuration file `openssl.cnf` from my github repository [here](https://github.com/sundeepkamath/CreatingSelfSignedCertificates/blob/master/openssl/openssl.cnf).
Place this file under the `ca` folder.

Once done, your directory structure would look like ...

![Initial Directory with openssl config]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/3Openssl_InitialDirectory.png)

Open the `openssl.cnf` file and update the root directory path based of your own user home directory path.

![Initial Directory update dir path in openssl config]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/4Openssl_InitialDirectory.png)

With this, our initial directory structure is ready and we can proceed to the next step of creating the Root CA.

## Creating a custom Root Certificate

This can be created in 3 steps.

### 1. Create the root key

{% highlight bash %}
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/ca.key.pem 4096
{% endhighlight %}

When prompted for a passphrase provide the same.

![Root CA root key]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/1Openssl_RootCA.png)

The root key is now stored in the `private` directory in the file `ca.key.pem`

**Note:**  
Use 4096 bits for all root certificates.
Youâ€™ll still be able to sign server and client certificates of a shorter length.

### 2. Create the root certificate
We can now create the root certificate `ca.cert.pem` using the root key `ca.key.pem` and openssl configuration file `openssl.cnf`

{% highlight bash %}
openssl req -config openssl.cnf \
      -key private/ca.key.pem \
      -new -x509 -days 3650 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca \
      -out certs/ca.cert.pem
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:**  
The Root CA validity can be of a longer duration (10 years in this case).
Once the root certificate expires, all certificates signed by the CA become invalid.

When the command is executed, it will ask you for a passphrase and then prod you to specify various details to be incorporated in your certificate request.

![Root CA certificate]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/2Openssl_RootCA.png)

With this our Root CA certificate is now created.

## Creating a server certificate signed by the Root CA

This can be performed in 3 steps...

### 1. Create a key for the server certificate

{% highlight bash %}
openssl genrsa -out private/www.funsoft.com.key.pem 2048
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:**   
Server and client certificates normally expire after one year, so we can safely use 2048 bits instead of 4096 bits used in Root certificates.

![Server Cert Key gen]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/1Openssl_ServerCert.png)

### 2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
We will now use the private key created (`www.funsoft.com.key.pem`), to create a certificate signing request (CSR).

{% highlight bash %}
openssl req -config openssl.cnf \
      -key private/www.funsoft.com.key.pem \
      -new -sha256 -out csr/www.funsoft.com.csr.pem
{% endhighlight %}

![Server CSR]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/2Openssl_ServerCert.png)

As shown above, provide the certificate details when it prods for it. The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) - `www.funsoft.com.csr.pem` is generated under the `csr` folder.

**Note:**  
For **server certificates**, the `Common Name` must be a fully qualified domain name (eg, www.funsoft.com), whereas for **client certificates** it can be any unique identifier (eg, an e-mail address).

### 3. Create server certificate signed by Root CA
We will now use the Root CA created earlier `ca.cert.pem` to sign the CSR `www.funsoft.com.csr.pem` and generate the server certificate `www.funsoft.com.cert.pem`

{% highlight bash %}
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf \
      -extensions server_cert -days 375 -notext -md sha256 \
      -in csr/www.funsoft.com.csr.pem \
      -out certs/www.funsoft.com.cert.pem
{% endhighlight %}

When it prods you for passphrase, provide the same. Provide the input `y` when it asks you to sign the certificate and `y` again when it asks you to commit the certified requests.

![Server Cert]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/3Openssl_ServerCert.png)

You'll find the certificate `www.funsoft.com.cert.pem` created under the `certs` folder.

**Note:**  
If the certificate is going to be used on a server, use the `server_cert` extension. If the certificate is going to be used for user authentication (client certificate), use the `usr_cert` extension.

## Packaging the certificate
Now that we have the certificate created, we need to package it appropriately so that it can be deployed easily. 
There are many different formats available to package certificates. One of the popular ones is `pfx`.

{% highlight bash %}
openssl pkcs12 -export -out www.funsoft.com.pfx \
        -inkey private/www.funsoft.com.key.pem \
        -in certs/www.funsoft.com.cert.pem \
        -certfile certs/ca.cert.pem
{% endhighlight %}

As can be seen in the command above we are packaging the **server certificate**, its **private key** and the **Root CA** used to sign this certificate in a `pfx` file.

![Package Server Cert]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/1Openssl_PackageServerCert.png)

Provide a password, when prodded for it. Later on, while deploying this certificate, you would have to provide this password.

## Deploying the certificate
Now that the `www.funsoft.com.pfx` file is generated, you can double-click on it and follow the wizard to import the **Server** and **Root CA** certificates in appropriate stores on Windows OS.

When it asks you to specify a store to store the certificate, choose the `Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate` option. 

![Deploy Server Cert]({{site.url}}/assets/images/blogs/1Openssl_Deploy.png)

Once the certificate is imported successfully, you'll find the **server certificate** with private key installed in the `Personal` store, while the **Root CA** imported in the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store.

The server certificate is now available for use with your website.

Hope this was useful!!
